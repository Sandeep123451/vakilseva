/* This file can be used for custom styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS. */
/* For this new design, most styles are handled directly in the HTML via Tailwind classes */
/* or in the <style> block in the <head> for complex animations. */

/* You can add specific overrides here if needed. For example: */
body {
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
